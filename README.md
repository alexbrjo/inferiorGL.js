InferiorGL.js 
==================================================

The graphics library I'm doubtful you're looking for
----------------------------------------------------

InferiorGL was designed to function just like a traditional graphics library, 
but due to my own lack of experience and poor attention to detail it's hard to 
call it a graphics library at at.

How to try it out
----------------------
1. Requires Grunt 0.4+ and a web browser that supports HTML5 canvas
2. Clone git repo and run grunt task 'build'
3. Open js console in your web browser and open ../test/index.html

Current Indev Task
----------------------
- Create normals for object faces
- Implement clip space and clip lines

Indev Tasks Completed
-------------------------
- Create objects for basic shapes
- Clip points completely behind plane tangent to camera
- Project 3D points onto the 2D display (thank you en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection)

Future Indev Tasks
---------------------
- Image rendering
- Object transformations
- parametric equation rendering
